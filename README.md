# XGBoost Tutorial

---

University project which describes XGBoost with an example Dataset :)

We will make a MD for Philipp because of Knowledge Mangement ðŸ¥°

## Concept for the project

1. Data Analysis and Visualization (25%)
    - Philipp Meyer
    - search for state of the art structure for eda
    - includes Data Cleaning !!!
    - finding variables

> Requirements: - Comprehensive analysis of the collected data, including statistical insights or observations. - Use of appropriate visualizations to represent training progress, performance, or other relevant aspects. - Descriptive annotations accompanying charts/graphs to provide clear interpretations. - Effective communication of the obtained insights and observations from the analysis.

2. Implementation (30%)
    - Ole Schildt
    - Why has it such a high percentage?
    - Does it include the explaination etc?
    - scikit learn XGBoost classifier but mention Regressor
    - connection to experimental setup needed

> Requirements: - Correct implementation of the chosen machine learning algorithm using the selected framework. - Clear and well-organized code structure. 3. Experimental setup (20%)

    - Ole Schildt
    - Is something like MLFlow needed for tracking
    - evaluate which metrics will we need
    - some visualizations to make all happy
    - hyperparameter tuning

> Requirements: - Thorough exploration of hyperparameter settings, including appropriate ranges. - Proper tracking and logging of training progress using relevant metrics. - Adequate number of experiments conducted to support meaningful analysis.

4. Comparision (15%)
    - Janis Hahn
    - explain CatBoost and LGMB in a overview
    - short implementation
    - tuning needed?
    - same metrics for evaluation of course
    - conclusion in MD table

> Requirements: - Inclusion of a comparison between multiple algorithms. - Clear explanation of the compared algorithms and their respective performances. - Thorough analysis of the comparison results, highlighting strengths and weaknesses of each algorithm. - Insightful discussion on the implications of the comparison and its relevance to the project topic.

5. Conclusion and Future Directions (10%)
    - together
    - should it be included in PP or/and Notebook

> Requirements: - Clear and concise summary of the main findings and insights obtained from the project. - Thoughtful discussion on the limitations of the implementation and potential improvements. - Overall coherence and logical flow of the conclusion section.

6. Documentation and Presentation (10%)
    - together
    - are medium etc okay as reference?
    - PP with mathematical explaination?

> Requirements: - Well-documented Jupyter Notebook with clear explanations and comments. - Proper organization of sections, including introduction, methodology, results, and conclusion. - Clarity of language, grammar, and overall readability. - Appropriate use of references, citations, and acknowledgments.
